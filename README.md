# arXiv Vanity FireFox Extension

There is a cool site that turns [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) pdfs into web pages, called [arXiv-Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/). I made a small extension to redirect you from an arXiv abstract to the html version.

I originally added a button in the arXiv downloads tab but saw [this extension](https://github.com/MrinalJain17/arxiv-vanity-firefox) which had done that already. So I changed mine to a redirect, which saves me a click.
